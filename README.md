Join Algorithms in Python
===============================

This repository contains implementations of various join algorithms in Python.

The objective is to demonstrate different join algorithms that are used in distributed data processing systems. The implementations are designed to be simple and easy to understand, making them suitable for educational purposes and should not be used in production systems.
The implemented join algorithms include:
- Hash Join
- Sort-Merge Join
- Grace Hash Join
- External Sort-Merge Join

Feel free to explore the code, run the examples, and modify them to better understand how these algorithms work!
